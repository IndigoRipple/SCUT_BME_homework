# Project1 
In this project, you will design a simple Student Management System (SMS) for your class. 
1.	Students attribute information: student-ID, name, age, sex, class
2.	The SMS can display all students’ information.
3.	The SMS can add a new student.
4.	The SMS can delete a new student
5.	The SMS can update a student’s information.
6.	The SMS can query student information by querying the student-ID
The student name list comes from your own class, and the SMS system outputs the student information into a .txt file.
